### 💌 hey there! 

I'm Sarah Ciston (they). I love building community through creative-critical code and building intersectional tools for AI. I'm the Professor of Computational Thinking and Aesthetic Doing at Kunsthochschule für Medien Köln (Academy of Media Arts Cologne), where I run Code Collective, an inviting space for co-learning programming and critical AI. I'm currently researching how military AI decision-making systems overlap with everyday tech.

<!--My PhD is from USC's Media Arts and Practice division. I'm an Associated Researcher at the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society, a recent AI Fellow at the Akademie der Künste (Art) Berlin, and a Google Season of Docs Mentor and Technical Writer with Processing Foundation's P5.js, where I've been working on all things Critical AI. This summer I'll be a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Internet Studies, working on intersectional datasets for machine learning and on ML tasks in warfare. -->
