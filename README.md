### ðŸ’Œ hey there! 

I'm Sarah Ciston (they). I love building community through creative-critical code and building intersectional tools for AI. I did my PhD at USC's Media Arts and Practice division. I'm an Associated Researcher at the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society, a recent AI Fellow at the Akademie der KÃ¼nste (Art) Berlin, and a Google Season of Docs Mentor and Technical Writer with Processing Foundation's P5.js, where I've been working on all things Critical AI. 

This summer I'll be am a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Internet Studies, working on intersectional datasets for machine learning and on ML tasks in warfare.
