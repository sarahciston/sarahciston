### 💌 hey there! 

I'm Sarah Ciston (they/any). I love building community through creative-critical code and building intersectional tools for AI. I'm the [Professor of Computational Thinking and Aesthetic Doing](https://khm.de) at Kunsthochschule für Medien Köln (Academy of Media Arts Cologne), where I run [Code Collective](https://codecollective.org)--a community for co-learning programming using approachable, interdisciplinary strategies. I'm currently researching how military AI decision-making systems overlap with everyday tech. You can reach me almost everywhere **@sarahciston**
